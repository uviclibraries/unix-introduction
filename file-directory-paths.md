# File and Directory Paths

Before we jump into some Unix commands, it’s worth defining two key
terms:

**Files**: Objects on a computer that store data, information, settings,
or commands when used with a computer program.

**Directories**: Also called “folders”, are the units that hold files or
other directories.

## Paths

A path is a string of characters that specifies a unique location in a
directory hierarchy. A file path specifies the location of a file in a
computer’s file system structure.

The below picture illustrates the directory structure of a typical
computer. Within this structure, the path to my Desktop would be:

**/Users/Rochlinn/Desktop**

When dealing with paths, directories are denoted by a slash “/”, and
each “layer” of the directory hierarchy is separated with a slash.
