# Pre Workshop Activities

## Setup

Before beginning this lesson, youâ€™ll need to do a few things:

1.  Download
    [shell-lesson-data.zip](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip)
    and move the file to your desktop
2.  Unzip/extract the file. **Let your instructor know if you need help
    with this step**. You should end up with a new folder called
    `shell-lesson-data` on your Desktop.
3.  If you are working on a Windows machine, you will need to download
    Git for Windows.  [Click here for instructions to
    download](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#shell){:target="_blank"}.
    If you are using a Mac or Linux system, you do not need to download
    any additional software (lucky you!).
