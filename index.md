## What is the Unix Shell?

The Unix Shell is a way to interact with your computer by providing it
with textual instructions. This can seem daunting to new users, but it
is a very powerful tool that, with some foundational understanding, can
be used for a number of different computational and data management
tasks.

### Why use the shell?

- Very valuabl as background knowledge for learning coding languages for the first time
- Easily automate file/folder movements that are often repeated
- Easily integrates with other tools and platforms in data workflows and pipelines
- Connect to remote machines and high-performance computing clusters

## Learning Objectives:

**Audience**: 
<br>
This session is intended to be a slow and encouraging
introduction to the Unix Shell, aimed at those that have little to no
experience with this tool.

By the end of this workshop, you will:
* Become familiar with the command line interface and file paths
* Execute Unix commands to navigate through the files and folders in your computer
* Create a directory hierarchy, and use an editor to create files in that
hierarchy
* Edit, move, and remove files and directories using Unix commands
